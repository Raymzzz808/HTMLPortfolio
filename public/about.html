<img src="../assets/PP.jpeg" height="200"/>
<p>Aloha My name is Raymond.
  <br/>I am an award-winning artist/photographer from Honolulu, Hawaii.
  As a life-long learner and individual looking to gain more knowledge and skills in life,
  I am currently taking up a Web Developer course from world, reknown Dr.Angela on Udemy. I have just learned to
  build my own HTML website via code, but will be soon developing a more comprehensive website through various 
  methods of coding!
